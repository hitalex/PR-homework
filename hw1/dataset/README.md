Dataset descriptions
===========

All these datasets are downloaded from [UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/). Some of them are pre-processed to share the same format.

For any dataset, e.g. the 'iris' dataset, 'iris.train' is the training set and 'iris.test' is the test set. 

In each line of training or test set, class labels are at the end of each line, like 0,1,2,... 

Number of features and class labels can be easily inferred from training and test set.
